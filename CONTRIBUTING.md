# Contributing to HyperQuark

## I found a bug
You should check first if there is already an issue for the bug. If there is, feel free to add any supporting information that you feel would be helpful in a comment. If there isn't, you should [create an issue](https://github.com/hyperquark/hyperquark), including as much detail as possible, including a description of the expected and observed behaviour, which projects you see this behaviour in, and whether this was observed on the hyperquark website or a local build.

## There's a feature I'd like
First think: is it reasonable? If the answer is yes, check if there are any issues for this feature (remember to check for closed issues), and if there aren't, you can create one yourself.

## I'd like to contribute to the codebase
Does the thing you want to code have an open, triaged issue for it? If not, it probably won't be accepted (unless it's a trivial, obviously beneficial change), so you should consider opening an issue first to discuss it. If there is an open issue, it's probably fine to work on it, however, if there is an assignee on the issue then you should ask them first before starting work on it.

## First time contributions
If you're looking for a good place to get started, "easier" issues have the ["good first issue" label](https://github.com/HyperQuark/hyperquark/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
